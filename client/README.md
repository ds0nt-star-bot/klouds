## Gamification is recommended.

If you can remember a troublesome Klouds mishap.

Roll a d20.

1. A roll of 5 to 15 is pretty normal, proceed as usual.

2. A roll below 5 is pretty bad. if you got a 1 (gods have mercy), you better just restart your computer before things auto-save... 2, 3, 4, 5 just the page. Run!

3. A roll of 15 - 19 is rather effective. You should probably get a trophy, but if you file an issue, I will most certainly add you to awesome.md

4. A roll of 20 means your **too awesome for apostrphies and sub-omnipotence**. Leaning back into a posture that chiropractors would find invalidating, you have earn my permission to grab your todo and cross everything off with complete confidence, marking it as complete.

GG.
